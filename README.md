# Crop-Yield-Prediction

In this project you can give inputs and get the output of yield 

Inputs will be in(units):

The area --> 1000 hectares

Nitrogen consumption --> tons

Phosphate consumption --> tons

potash consumption --> tons

Rainfall --> millimeters


The output (units)

production --> 1000 tonnes

yield --> kg/hectare
