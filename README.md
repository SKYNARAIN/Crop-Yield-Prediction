# Crop-Yield-Prediction

In this project you can give inputs and get the output of yield \n
Inputs will be in(units):
The area --> 1000 hectares
Nitrogen consumption --> tons
Phosphate consumption --> tons
potash consumption --> tons
Rainfall --> millimeters

the output (units)
production --> 1000 tonnes
yield --> kg/hectare
